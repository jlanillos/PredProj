The directory ~/PredProj/bin/functions contains all the necessary functions to run SVM and some useful scripts to prepare the data, read results...

In order to run SVM, it is necessary to open one of the files called like 'main_script...', specify the parameters, folder and paths as required, save and and run python. There are several files called 'main_script...' because they have been used for different steps of the project:


main_script.py associated to runSVM.py: It runs SVM without psiblast information. The other files similarly called run pretty similar but with different purposes and including Evolutionary information from psiblast.

main_script_50proteins.py associated to runSVM_50prot.py

main_script_imp_perfo_GRIDSEARCH.py associated to runSVM_imp_perfo_GRIDSEARCH.py 

main_script_imp_perfo.py associated to runSVM_imp_perfo.py           

main_script_psiblast.py associated to runSVM_psiblast.py 

main_script_RMF.py associated to runRFC.py: RANDOMFOREST calculation


The folder Utilities contains some scripts to read the results and get them to plot, analyze them...
It also contains the bash file that runs psiblast to extract the evolutionary information from each sequence.
